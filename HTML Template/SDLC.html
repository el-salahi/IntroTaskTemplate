            <h2 class="h" id="planning-h"><span class="stage-title">Planning</span></h2>
            <p>The planning phase sets the direction for the entire project. This involves gathering initial requirements, conducting feasibility tests, and project planning.
            During initial requirement gathering the goals and scope of the project are defined. Stakeholders are identified, and align on their expectations.<br>Feasibility studies are conducted to assess technical, operational, and financial viability. During technical assessments the team chooses technologies or frameworks that align with business goals.
            <br>During planning a high level roadmap is created to guide the development, including timelines, resources, and budget estimates.<br>Main contributors in this phase include:</p>
            <p class="italics">Project managers, product owners, tech leads, senior engineers, and stakeholders.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="requirements" class="body-section">
            <h2 class="h" id="requirements-h"><span class="stage-title">Requirements</span></h2>
            <p>This phase expands of initial needs and expectations set by stakeholders, gathering detailed functional and non-functional requirements. This involves identifying what software should do, how it should perform, and any constraints it must operate within. User stories are developed to capture these needs clearly. The outcome is a well-defined set of specifications that guide design and development.<br>Main contributors in this phase include:</p>
            <p class="italics">Project owners, business analysts, stakeholders, UX designers, end-users, and sometimes engineerss.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="design" class="body-section">
            <h2 class="h" id="design-h"><span class="stage-title">Design</span></h2>
            <p>The design phase translates requirements into a technical blueprint from which to build the software. System architecture, data models, and UI designs are planned to ensure scalability, usability, and maintainability. UX/UI designers create wireframes and prototypes, while architects deliver high and low level designs and along with engineers define the technology stack. This stage ensures that all components are well-structured before coding begins.<br>Main contributors in this phase include:</p>
            <p class="italics">UX/UI designers, system architects, tech leads, and senior engineers.</p>

        <section id="development" class="body-section">
            <h2 class="h" id="development-h"><span class="stage-title">Development</span></h2>
            <p>This is the phase where the actual coding takes place. Developers build the software according to the design specifications. It involves the development and unit testing of system components, and intergration into a full system.<br>Main contributors in this phase include:</p>
            <p class="italics">Software engineers (front-end, back-end, full stack), QA engineers, project managers and project owners</p>
        </section>

        <section id="testing" class="body-section">
            <h2 class="h" id="testing-h"><span class="stage-title">Testing</span></h2>
            <p>Testing ensures that the software built during development works as intended and meets quality standards. This includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing. QA engineers and teams validate functionality, performance, security, and accessibility against user requirements. Bugs are reported, fixed, and retested until the product is stable and ready for release.<br>Main contributors in this phase include:</p>
            <p class="italics">QA engineers, test automation engineers, and software engineers.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="deployment" class="body-section">
            <h2 class="h" id="deployment-h"><span class="stage-title">Deployment</span></h2>
            <p>In this stage, the completed and tested software is released to users, transitioning from development and testing environments, to a live production environment. There are many strategies for deployment, which strike difference balances between considerations such as infrastructure downtime, risk tolerance and deployment flexibility. The team monitors the release for issues and ensures systems are running as expected. Documentation and training may also be provided to support users and administrators.<br>Main contributors in this phase include:</p>
            <p class="italics">DevOps engineers, software engineers, and product owners</p>
        </section>

        <section id="maintenance" class="body-section">
            <h2 class="h" id="maintenance-h"><span class="stage-title">Maintenance</span></h2>
            <p>Maintenance involves ongoing support after deployment to keep the software secure, efficient, and up to date. This includes fixing bugs, patching vulnerabilities, optimizing performance, and adding new features as user needs evolve. User feedback and system monitoring guide these improvements. Regular updates help extend the softwareâ€™s lifecycle and relevance.<br>Main contributors in this phase include:</p>
            <p class="italics">Software engineers, QA engineers, support teams, and product owners.</p>
