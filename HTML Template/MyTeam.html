        <h2 class="h" id="my-role-h"><span class="stage-title">My Role</span></h2>
        <p>I am a junior software engineer within a full stack team. I contribute to both front-end and back-end components under the guidance of more experienced team members. Some of my responsibilities are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A significant portion of my responsibilities involves writing, maintaining, and testing code across our team's services and applications. I adhere to the coding standards and best practices established by my organization. I do this under guidance from senior team members, who help me understand the codebase and the architectural decisions that have been made.
            </li>
            <li>Testing is a key part of my role. I contribute by writing unit tests to ensure adequate code coverage, performing basic manual testing, and supporting the development and maintenance of our integration test suite to help ensure reliability across systems.
            </li>
            <li>I participate in code reviews, where I both provide feedback to peers and, more importantly as a junior team member, receive feedback on my own work. This process helps me continually improve the quality of the code I produce.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Senior Software Engineers are responsible for designing, developing, and maintaining complex systems across the full stack. They lead technical decision-making, and are often the point of contact for cross-functional team collaboration. They also support junior engineers by providing guidance and sharing best practices. These additional responsibilies often lead to less time in the code-base, but instead a focus on architecture and design.</p>

        <h2 class="h" id="qa-role-h"><span class="stage-title">QA Tester</span></h2>
        <p>QA (Quality Assurance) Testers are responsible for ensuring that software meets the required quality standards before it's released. They design and execute test plans, perform both manual and automated testing, and identify bugs or issues early in the development process. QA testers work closely across a whole team - with Product and UX to understand requirements and define acceptance criteria, and with developers to then validate the user experience and functionality of the software.</p>
        <h3>Karthika, QA Engineer</h3>
        <p>Karthika is the QA engineer on our team, ensuring comprehensive test coverage for our application, giving our team confidence in every deployment. Karthika collaborates closely with developers like myself to identify and resolve issues as part of our agile process. All front-end development in our application must pass through her testing environment for validation and approval before release.</p>
